You are Gemini CLI. I have a React app from Google AI Studio (scientific calculator) with App.tsx and package.json.



Your job:



Inside my current folder, set it up as an Expo React Native project called "calculator-app". Do not try to create a new folder outside this one.



Replace the starter App.tsx with my AI Studio App.tsx.



Merge dependencies and install them.



Run "expo prebuild" so I get android/ and ios/ folders.



Use package name: com.nana.calculator



Do NOT generate app icons. I will provide my own 1024x1024 icon.



Verify gradle and AndroidManifest are correct and error-free.



Stop after confirming the android/ folder is fully ready for Android Studio.
